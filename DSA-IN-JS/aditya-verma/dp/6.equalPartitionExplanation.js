/**
 * We will sum up the array.
 * If array sum is odd, it means we cant find 2 subsets with same sum.
 * Example: [1,2,4] 
 * 
 * If even, then we can find subset whose sum is equal to totalSumOfArray/2 (Just like previous question).
 * And Logically remaining subarray will have equal sum as well.
